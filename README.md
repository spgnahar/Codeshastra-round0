# Inventory-Management-Website
Inventory Mangement Website is a Django website developed in a hackathon in a duration of 6 hours. 

The problem statement for the same was: 
Develop a creative platform for the public and scientists (in any field of study) alike to learn the definitions of jargons (Scientific and technical terms), using the power of crowdsourcing. Anybody can learn new things, post new doubts / questions and answer someone else's posts.

The website had 2 main parts : The Forum and the Jargon

Functionalities of the Forum:

1. Users can view the different questions and their multiple answers given. 
2. Each question has an additional tag whether answered or unanswered, enabling the user to know if the question has an asnwer or not.
3. User can add their own answer to the answers already given for any question.

Additional functionalities that could have been implemented:

1. A voting feature for each answer so that the most relevant answer lies at the top.
2. Sorting out the questions type-wise so that user can search through the questions using keywords.

Functionalities of the Jargon:

1. Definition - search any keyword and you get the formal definition for the same using the help of PyDictionary. One can also add their own definitions for other people to see.
2. Youtube Search - search any keyword and get a list of related videos, playlists and channels.
3. Coursera Search - search any keyword and get a list of all relevant courses for that keyword.
